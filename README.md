# Pneumo API
Django-based API for Pneumothorax Detection using Custom Trained U-Net Model

## Description
This repository contains a Django-based API for pneumothorax detection using a custom trained U-Net model. The U-Net model is a deep learning architecture widely used for semantic segmentation tasks, including medical image analysis.

The API allows users to upload chest X-ray images, which are then processed by the custom trained U-Net model to detect the presence of pneumothorax. Pneumothorax is a medical condition where air accumulates in the pleural space, causing the lung to collapse partially or completely.

## Features
- Upload chest X-ray images for pneumothorax detection.
- Utilize a custom trained U-Net model for accurate segmentation.
- Real-time processing of images for quick results.
